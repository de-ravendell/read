# Les Larmes Du Thestral

*J'ustilise le crépuscule comme ma plume,*  
*pour écrire les étoiles qui emplissent le ciel.*

## Chapter I
Sycamore Alley.   
Nerds' Bookstore.   
Go upstairs and get into the fireplace with some Bloo Powder.   
Crépuscule Manoir.   
I couldn't be more familiar with this path.   
Even now I still consider my ancestors so admirable for opening up a shortcut to our manor from the world of Muggles, rather than getting a ride on the slow school train or flushing myself into the toilet.   
The empty Crépuscule Manoir always brings me thoughts and sighs.   
I live in a large family, or at least before the most shocking incident after the fall of Voldemort took place, I lived in one.  
Years ago, the manor was filled with people, my parents, my grandparents, my brothers, my sisters, my cousins, my friends. Some of them were celebrities with extraordinary feats, others were once-in-a-century geniuses. But now, there is only a single resident within the previously glorious family. As a witness to that inhuman massacre, I don't know how lucky I was that day, when I dared not breathe in that wardrobe. Hundreds, maybe thousands, of powerful wizards were killed on that day, but it seemed that they've forgotten the young boy hiding in the clothes. The air reeked of burnt spells and blood, the screams still echoing in my nightmares. Sometimes I wish I had stepped out of that wardrobe - not to fight, but to at least see their faces one last time, and embrace the not-so-horrible death in the warmth of family.  
Fortunately, I didn't become famous as Harry did for that, or Dumbledore may come and send me to a Muggle family to experience a harsher life, even if my life has been difficult enough since. Well, of course he wouldn't, not after he fell off the tower in Hogwarts, but I'm not sure if Professor McGonagall would do.  
However, the event brought the entire magic world a significant difference.  
The attackers left nothing but piles of bodies and a notorious and feared name - the Thanatoists.  

## Chapter II
As known, eleven is the age for a wizard to join Hogwarts the magical school, and I'm not an exception. After receiving my letter of admission delivered by a poor owl who nearly fell over because of the protective charms around our manor, I knew it was time to make some preparations.  
To be ready for the coming school year materially, every student should go to Leaky Cauldron in order to reach Diagon Alley, probably the most known commercial street for wizards in Britain.  
But Leaky Cauldron is in London, while I live in Scotland.  
Too far.  
I think that's why my creative ancestors established a Nerds' Bookstore there.  
Nerds' Bookstore had become a chain store all over the important places for the De Ravendell family, ranging from Sycamore Alley, the hometown of the very first De Ravendell wizard, to a hidden room within the Ministry of Magic, which was obviously unauthorised and illegal. We did sell books in the bookstores, well, not the ones in the Ministry of Magic (we don't wanna lose that shortcut) or Sycamore Alley (or Obliviate would be needed for some Muggles), but usually with magic, especially after the sudden decrease of population. It's such a pity we weren't able to open one in Hogwarts or Hogsmeade because of the insistence of the headmasters. 
Initially we used to legally use Floo Powder as the way of transportation. However, a shortage soon arose. To avoid suspicions, those brilliant people introduced Bloo Powder, which was as its name, blue instead of green. It not only solved the crisis but also improved the safety of the means.  
Opening the door with blue flames cooling down behind, I saw crowds of people here and there. Some walking, some talking, some thinking, some drinking.  
I hated crowds.  
Just hated.  
I didn't really know why. Probably because they always reminded me of the family I used to have.  
So I just headed to where I must head to.  
Ollivanders.  
Although I'd been flying on broomsticks for long, I hadn't been exposed to a wand before. I felt a strange feeling of excitement, as if I was a starving lion who finally found a piece of meat to have.  
Mr Ollivander raised his head with a smile as I walked in, "My dear, you need a wand don't you." He dropped his quill and went to the shelves.  
Soon his voice came from behind the shelves."Merlin's beard! This wand has been shaking ever since you walked in. Why not try it," He took it off the perhaps innermost shelf and handed it a long cube box to me, "12 and a quarter inches, maple, rigid, and thestral tail hair. Special. Really special."  
Mr Ollivander's dusty fingers trembled as he pried open the cobwebbed box.  
"This wand wept silver tears the day Grindelwald fell," he whispered.  
When my skin touched the maple wood, the shop's thousands of wand boxes began rattling like a chorus of buried bones.  
The thestral hair core sang a dirge only we could hear.  
And then the magic part began.  
Just as Mr Ollivander had said, it was very special.  
It would have appeared that the whole world was darkened, and some magical silvery strands of faint lights appeared and floated around me, as if they were strings of musical notes of a divine elegy, purifying my soul, and purifying the world.  
"Bravo!" Mr Ollivander laughed and clapped, "Bravo! I haven't seen thus strong resonance for long! Boy, you are no mediocre! It should be 7 Galleons for the wand, but boy, I'd gift it to you for free!"  
I had no idea if I was no mediocre, but I was certain that I was no expert on talking. I didn't know what to do and thus said a plain thank you and went out of Ollivanders.  
Luckily I didn't need any books or cauldrons or quills or stuff as there are enough left-overs from my brothers and sisters, so I had done my job and was time to go home.  
When holding those, I always couldn't help shaking my head with long sighs.  
Walking back, my eyes wanderered onto the Magical Menagerie. Owls and lizards and cats and all kinds of intelligent animals looking at me curiously, as if I was the one inside some kinds of cages for them to watch.  
Well, although I love animals, I don't need any more of them. Hugin and Munin had already been enough for me.  
In the fireplace of Nerds' Bookstore, Bloo Powder lit up blue flames, a figure disappeared suddenly as it walked in.  
But it didn't show up in Crépuscule Manoir.  

## Chapter III  
Thanks to the location of Crépuscule Manoir, I didn't have to take the crowded train as the majority do. Instead, I rode my Ombre 11 broomstick to the destination with no worries of being caught by some Muggles.  
I think my talent of broom-flying might be inherited from my father, who used to be a fantastic Quidditch chaser at school that made De Ravendell a name all keepers fears. Since I was a kid, I could fly on broomsticks and play some acrobatics as well as, or even better than, other juveniles do.  
It was no more than a five-minute journey from the manor to the school, which made me the very first student to arrive. There, as all newcomers do, I met Professor Hagrid.  
"Oh boy! If there's a record fer bein' early, yer certainly breakin' it! It's over an hour!"  
"True. But it's alright isn't it? May I beg you to send me across Black Lake in advance? I hate crowds."  
"I shouldn'ta done that but alright. I'll bring yeh there. Just be sure yeh don't get lost." Hagrid murmured, but with his featured rough and loud voice.  
And thus, I was there, across the Black Lake.  
Staring at the shining stars, appreciating the sparkling waves, following the drifting leaves, feeling the gentle breeze.  
I don't think I'd ever had an hour so remarkable.  
It was just as if the entire world was designed for me.  
Only me.  
I smiled. For the first time ever since that massacre.  
If some day I mastered some time-freezing charm, I would like to go back there, and be sitting by the bank forever.  
Forever.  
However, soon some lamps on the lake broke the plain peace.  
I didn't join them to the Great Hall. Instead, I hid behind a willow and followed after.  
It appeared to me that I arrived just on time, when Hagrid started to doubt if it was wise to let me go and began worrying about the scenario after my disappearance. Maybe he had finished his scripts of answering Professor McGonagall's angry questioning.  
To his relief, that wasn't long. I showed up before Professor McGonagall asked anything.  
Then it was the Sorting Ceremony.  
I'd heard about the ugly Sorting Hat for several times. Now it was sitting on a chair in silence, which it soon broke that. 
And it started singing, about the four houses and the four great founders.  
The ceremony was rather boring. Standing in the crowd and waiting for my name called wasn't an easy job for me.  
Soon did Professor McGonagall call my name.  
"De Ravendell, Odin." she called.  
I calmly and simply walked to the chair and sat.  
The hat shouted before I could put it onto my head, "Ravenclaw!" 
Of course I didn't receive a Weaslish welcome from anyone, as my fame wasn't worth a "we have De Ravendell" stuff.  
The bustle time filled with names, houses, claps and shouts didn't last so long, and soon we finished sorting and the dinner. 
It was time for rest.  
We were led to the tall tower in the west by Colin Walker the prefect of Ravenclaw. "This," he pointed to a bronze eagle-shaped doorknocker as we were reaching the tower and said, "is our common room. 'Witness beyond measure is man's greatest treasure.' We don't use passwords to get access. Instead, we answer riddles. For example..." he knocked on the door and immediately the knocker came alive. 
It rolled its eyes and studied us, "Hmmm, never seen you guys. Wanna come in? Answer this: name a thing you can break without touching it."  
Before Walker could ever take a shot, I whispered, "Peace."  
But it was still too loud.  
The knocker cheered, "What a creative one! I've been bored of 'record's and 'promise's and 'silence's, but yours is wonderful. Now I see why you're here. Come in please, you new Ravenclaws."  
Finally I could see the Ravenclaw Common Room with my own eyes.  
It was believed that Ravenclaw Common Room was the most beautiful one among all four, and I'd heard all kinds of excitements and regrets and praises and fulfillments.  
But a glance overshadows all words.  
The room was spacious, airy and quiet, with arched windows offering such stunning views of the mountains and the Black Lake outside. Looking up, it was a domed, starry ceiling resembling the night sky and enchanted to reflect the current heavens I couldn't extol enough. Among the bookshelves, comfortable armchairs, study tables and tapestries which depict famous Ravenclaws and riddles, there was an absolutely eye-catching beautiful white marble statue of Rowena Ravenclaw, the house's founder, standing near the entrance. 
If there was a doubt on the beauty inside the common room, it was certainly the most ridiculous idea on earth.  
I didn't know how long had I stayed there appreciating the best designed room in the world, but what I knew was that I was the last to be in the dormitory.  
It wasn't a big year for Ravenclaw, with three boys and four girls, and thus, although all boys in my year were in the dorm, it was rather empty.  
My roommates were Lorcan and Lysander Scamander. They were a pair of friendly twins who exactly inherited their mother Mrs Luna Scamander's appearance.  
Mrs Luna Scamander.  
Was she doing well?  
Staring at the Tenebris Orb in my hand, hearing the odd conversations between the twins, I felt into thought.  

## Chapter IV
It was after the massacre, when I, the youngest descendant of an ancient and powerful family, finally became an orphan and a wanderer.  
A wanderer, literally.  
Although Crépuscule Manoir wasn't yet destroyed - thanks to the Thanatoists for only killing but not demolishing, I couldn't stand the bloody smell as if my manor was an old church filled with rust. Every dream I had there was about nothing but that day, when screams and cries echoed in my head, torturing my mind, engulfing my soul. These memories haunted me and showed me that I would always be living with this painful scar and this frightening nightmare.  
So did I wander.  
Edinburgh's rain, London's fog, Dublin's pubs, all blurred in my endless way.  
Wandering was never something cool.  
It was hunger and cold and despair.  
But that was still much better than being trapped in a day I wish I could forever forget.  
Oui.  
"Death can't be more horrible." I said to myself as my consciousness dissipated, "It's time for a reunion."  
And that, was the last thought in my mind, before I woke up and found myself under a sheet of soft blanket on a sofa in a cozy little room, where a woman wearing an odd pair of glasses was reading a magazine titled Quibbler upside down.  
She lifted her eyes and saw me sitting up.  
"The Wrackspurts are especially loud around bad dreams." She muttered as putting down the magazine.  
"Your deduction does you credit. How may I address you? And could you please tell me where I am now?"  
"Luna Scamander, nice to meet you. And as for where you are, in fact, now you are in a suitcase." Her voice was calm, in a detached and dreamy manner.  
"I guess I haven't got the point." I couldn't help staring at the table with dishes on it.  
"Just have them if you want. And then I'll show you around. Poor boy, long time no rest do you?"  
That was a strange feeling, for the first time since that had happened two years ago, I felt an angelic warmth that is called, I'd nearly forgotten, care.  
As an aristocracy, I considered gobbling up rude. However, when I sprang off the sofa and charged to the table, devouring everything I could see, I cared no manner.  
Though there was none of the French cuisines as the ones on the long dining table of Crépuscule Manoir - no truffle-infused pâté nor caramelised ortolans, but somewhere between my third and forth helping, I realised it was the first meal I'd had without ashes or mice in the past two years. I can't find a meal more delicious throughout my life.  
I didn't know how long it took me to finish. I couldn't even name a thing I ate there.  
The only thing I am certain, is that it always feels sweet to reminiscent about it.  
Then did Mrs Luna take me around.  
As she had told me, it was a real suitcase.  
There was nothing special outside. But if you turned off the Muggle version, switched into the wizard one and tried climbing in, you'd find a magical world filled with magical creatures inside. Ranging from thunderbirds to nifflers, there were a huge variety of creatures, forming an amazing magizoo.  
Definitely amazing.  
No hyperbole, I was addicted to meeting those animals.  
I was addicted to Mrs Luna Scamander's magizoo in her suitcase.  
Seasons went by quietly and I finally I realised that I had been living with her for a year, as if she was my mum.  
I'd owed her so much. Her food, her company, and her gifts given when I was about to leave for Crépuscule Manoir at the age of ten.  
On that day, she was still wearing her featured Spectrespecs that I counld't exactly see if her eyes were weeping.  
She gifted me two, one was the twin ravens, which she named as Hugin and Munin, the other one a small dark sphere within which some silvery strings glowed. She explained to me that the sphere was called Tenebris Orb, and was an outcome of her husband's grandfather Newton's researches of Demiguises and Thestrals. She gave it to me because she felt "an indescribable connection" between the sphere and me.  
Everytime I looked at Tenebris Orb, I would be amazed by the wonderfulness of magical creatures and the skills of magizoolists.  
Back in the dormitory, I found myself in an unexpectedly good mood. 
Suddenly, a loud crash shattered my reminiscence.  
And then it was a shrill scream.  

## Chapter V
The duelling club wasn't started until they solved the Mystery of the Quakes.  
The initial occurrence of the incident was on the very first day for school.  
A severe shock got everyone off their places.  
Especially, it caused the crashes between tables and walls in Graffindor Common room, which promoted several screams in the bravest hall.  
In the following days, there were constantly forces pulling students off their seats. Thus, we were asked to stay within the common rooms. 
The terror lingered for a dozen of days.  
Even after Professor McGonagall made the announcement and claimed that it was nothing but an insignificant earthquake happened right beneath Hogwarts, and had been controlled by the professors, some students still consisted that it was not so easy.  
Voldemort had regained his power, was trying to revenge.  
A huge and dangerous magical creature was being incubated under the campus, waiting for its time to hatch.  
There was dark wizard between the first-years, deploying an evil scheme.  
Thanatoists, who had been quiet in the past few years, finally played their next tempo, aiming right at Hogwarts.  
You could always see the clever delivering their speeches in the corridors.  
Hugin and Munin were constantly noisy with no reason those days, leaving piles of feathers every morning for me to clean up.  
And there was no difference after the case of the mysterious shocks was closed.  
In fact, it appeared to me that they were even more naughty afterwards.  
Anyway, when the club was launched, it was already half a month after the opening day.  
Ron Weasley, our Defence Against the Dark Arts professor, and Filius Flitwick, the professor of Charms, at the same time the Head of our house and the Deputy Head of Hogwarts, took the club as an important resource of studying, so we had to go and watch the duels even if we weren't eligible to participate in them as first-years, which wasn't really to my disappointment.  
In my view, comparing with "club", it was more accurate to describe it as a "cup".  
At the beginning of every school year, the school would organise the duelling club, offering a chance not only to duel with each other without being into trouble, but also to make new friends and experience new spells.  
It adopted a knockout system, with random pairs duelling to decide who to leave and who to stay, until there were only one participant per grade left. And each winner won 25 points for their House, which would lead to great advantages on House Cups rivalry.  
The first combatants were our prefect, Colin Walker, and a witch from Hufflepuff.  
The venue was in a very new classroom on the seventh floor, in which a protective charm was enchanted.  
After the traditional bow and the count down, it was time for free hexes.  
"Expelliarmus!"  

## Chapter VI
Immediately, a bolt flashed from Walker’s wand, streaking towards the Hufflepuff witch.  
She hastily jumped aside and waved her wand, shouting, “Fumos!”  
As the mist rising from her wand tip engulfed the duelling court, I could just make out her murmuring “Protego” before she vanished into the cloud.  
The fight became a spectacle of sound and light—incantations echoed, and flashes of colour pierced the mist, a vivid display of the Tyndall effect, like a painting no mortal hand could recreate. It ended only when the referee declared Walker the victor after a dazzling red light sent the witch crumpling to the ground.  
For Walker, it was effortless, but for us Ravenclaws, it became a torment. Professor Flitwick added every spell Walker had used to our syllabus - Wingardium Leviosa now buried under a mountain of new incantations.  
For experienced wizards, such spells were child’s play, but for beginners like us, they were a nightmare. Though Flitwick spent half the lesson raving about Walker’s final strike, even the quickest among us took a week to produce a barely passable Stupefy.  
I prefered studying the Hufflepuff witch’s charms than spending each lesson trying to knock my partner out, however, since I didn’t really have one. 
Without proper guidance, the workload doubled.  
The Scamanders rarely shared my interests, so Fumos became my nightly diversion. After an ill-fated attempt in the common room - which resulted in a miniature explosion, a reprimand from Professor McGonagall, and a ten-point deduction - I resolved to practise in the duelling club instead.  
After failing to calm down my ravens, who insisted to fly away, I went on my first rule-breaking adventure in Hogwarts.  
Yet when I slipped inside, dodging Filch and his constantly miaowing cat, the room was nothing like the usual court.  
The moment I crossed the threshold, an unnatural chill gripped me.   

## Chapter VII
I must admit, it was a definitely deadly night.  
Une nuit de mort.  
I couldn't believe how I'd survived.  
I didn't manage to go back after finishing shopping in Diagon Alley.  
In a blue flame I appeared in a completely unfamiliar place. It appeared that I was in a dungeon where no lights could ever access.  
With my new wand in hand, I tried casting the charm that I'd read millions of times in my father Gale's memoir of his adventures. "Lumos!"  
But it wasn't the bright light that was lit up on the wand tip. Instead, a dim silvery spot glowed.  
Still, I could see the circumstances. I was in front of a fireplace, but certainly not the one in Crépuscule Manoir, since no warmth of memories could be felt from the plain equipment. It seemed to be concealed by a spell. Smooth black stones formed the walls around me, proving a glooming atmosphere.  
I soon understood that I had been to the Ministry of Magic, as it was the only place that I wasn't familiar with on the Bloo Powder web.  
That should be a safe place. Altough I hadn't got enough powder to go to the manor, I had enough time to seek for another way out.  
Suddenly a torturous coldness creeped up through my body. I was back into the age of seven, within the wardrobe that often visited my nightmares, that contained my extreme fear when I was a step to death, that I wish I could forever forget.  
"Père!" I couldn't help yelling in the bloody smell that structured un enfer rempli de mort et de désespoir, making effort on knocking the door locked by my father who heard my voice. 
I felt a giant creature descending its head to me, but I just couldn't stop the movements promoted by the inmost fear. I visualised my soul dissipating.  
I was sinking, into the deep abyss that was filled with the dead, getting distance from the light of hope. Until a beautiful bright light barged inside and crumbled all the depressions and lit up all the darkness in my mind. It was a sleek and skeletral horse, ajoined with a pair of bat-like wings, that brought all the positive memories of mine back inside.  
It was an definitely unparalleled experience.  
Memories flooded my mind and thus I was, in a second, somehow dizzy. In the next, I found myself not in the dungeon but in front of a door in Hogwarts in which we usually watch duels.  
While I was still being thankful for the horse that saved my life, I heard a eerie laugh behind.  

## Chapter VIII
As I turned back, I saw a short ghost laughing sinisterly. And he, sorry, it started to preach, with its tone of mischief.  
"You know there is a curfew in Hogwarts don't you, first-year? Have you realise how many points might be taken from you house if you are off your bed at nights? At least twenty!"  
Didn't need his reminders, I certainly was conscious that I was violating some rules.  
Though I doubt if twenty points would have be taken away since Snape wasn't a professor anymore, I knew I'd have been in trouble if anyone had got me.  
I would prevent that from happening.  
In the tension, I pointed at the ghost with my wand.  
"Stupefy!"  
But that incantation didn't work well. No dazzling red bolt was lit up, but a tiny gloomy flash that seemed to be laughing at my unsuccessful attempt.  
That surely went on the ghost's nerves. It started shouting, "Student off his bed! Student off his bed!"  
I'd got to run.  
But apparently the ghost doesn't think so. He continuously followed me to wherever I fled with his yells.  
I, a little annoyed, swiftly turned around and casted a spell I loved the most, "Fumos."  
Proved by practise, stress does help learners.  
It agained started with a minor outburst, but not ended with an ultimatum by the headmistress. Thick dark smoke spread with the blast, making the corridors ideal for escape.  
That wasn't the full thing. The ghost appeared to be blindfolded somehow, crashing into every part of the walls we were going by, crying, "Filch! Filch! What the hell are you doing! Student abusing magic! Where the hell are you!"  
Couldn't help laughing.  
As I sneaked into the Ravenclaw Tower, I could still hear its voice clashing with Filch's.  
"Peeves! Is there a single student here? No misreporting again! And I'll tell Professor McGonagall about the smoke you've produced." 
Walking through the very empty Ravenclaw Common Room, I found myself so tiny in the palace of wisdom. I was nothing but one of the gloomy stars in the velvet night, would never overshadow the bright light of the moon.  
Never.  
But I would finally write the sky of mine, with myself being the figure with the brightest light.  
To my surprise, the window was suddenly opened, accompanied by two ravens that flew inside, with a terribly bad news.  

## Chapter IX
The Scamander twins weren't talking as usual in the first few weeks.   They just stared at each other silently as there were nothing to talk about.  
We all kept quiet to commemorated Luna Lovegood-Scamander.  
I wasn't recovered from the sorrow until something even more awful happened.  
That was a real threat.  
Heard from some Hufflepuffs, a first-year student in their house was possessed after he went to the duelling field by his own. He just couldn't stop laughing in the hospital wing.  
Madam Pomfrey had no idea what to do, and it was Professor Slughorn who came up with the idea of making a potion to put him to sleep.  
Was it the consequence if the dark giant had made its attack?  
Not so possible. As that giant was one of the worst memories of mine.  
Or was the creature making people recall their catastrophic experiences that they don't want to think of anymore? Plausible.  
I was just so curious that I forgot to be scared.  
For some reason I couldn't explain, I made a ridiculously bold decision to venture inside that room at midnight again.  
With my Tenebris Orb in hands, I sneaked out along the way through which I again managed to avoid Filch's detections and reached the room.  

(not yet finished)

*Je déroule le rouleau du temps,*  
*pour un instant qui dure pour toujours.*
